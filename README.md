# LocalCapsulePoolingNetwork
a graph pooling of cluster selecting method using capsule network
This algorithm assgin nodes within neighbnors to a few of clusters adaptively which enables local graph pooling. 
In the pooled graph, nodes connected under the guidance of low-level node adjacenciesï¼Œ which can preserve the graph structure than other methods.
At the same time, the node representations in the pooled graph can reconstruct more concretely nodes representations than other methods.
Even under the condition of reducing the number of nodes by 90 percent, the pooled node representations can still reconstructure the key node representation information in the graph reconstruct experiment.
